    <p>Thank you for choosing C2C, our time organizing program. However, Claror does not want to be known for just one program, C2C; We plan to make other programs and are also aiming for some hardware as we have experience in building computers.</p>
    <p>We hope you find our other projects interesting and inspire you to try out our most recent project.</p>
    <p>Our previous projects:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A robotic operating arm</li>
    <li>An extremely powerful calculator</li>
    <li>An extremely capable calculator</li>
    <li>Remote home system (can control LEDs, cameras, doorbells, speakers and other home appliances.)</li>
  </ul>
    <p>Claror is a technical organisation that has released one computer program so far. It prioritises when you will do your chores, but please remember it is still in development.</p>
   <p> </p>
   <p>Please take the survey or we won't know what to change to make it the best experience we can offer to you as an overworked or just curious person.</p>
   <p>-Thank You</p>
